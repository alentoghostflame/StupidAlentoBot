# StupidAlentoBot
Discord bot that's stupid and made by me, Alento. Contains a modular framework relying on PyYAML and Discord.py, along
with multiple modules.

## Requirements
* Python 3
* discord.py
* pyyaml

## Installation
1) Clone this repository and put it on disk.
2) (Optional) Create a virtual environment inside the cloned repo (`python3 -m venv venv`) and activate it. 
(`source venv/bin/activate`)
3) Install the dependencies. (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)

## Running
1) Uncomment/add the modules you wish to use in `start.py`
2) Run `python3 start.py`.
    1) If running for the first time, it will generate a `config.yaml` that your token will need to be put in.
